FMRI Analysis with different stimulation conditions


NIFTI data for Binocular visual fMRI data.
Medetomidine sedated animals  

Data acquired in a 9.4T Bruker Biospec MRI scanner (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany) equipped with an AVANCE III HD console including a gradient unit capable of producing pulsed field gradients of up to 660mT/m isotropically with a 120 μs rise time was used. An 86 mm quadrature coil was used for radio frequency transmission and a 4-element array cryoprobe (Bruker, Fallanden, Switzerland) was used for signal reception. 


Inside each frequency folder there are animal folders with the anatomical (T2-RARE) and functional (SE-EPI) NIFTI files.
Each run consists on 6 stimulation cycles.
One cycle: Stimulation period (15 seconds) + Rest period (45 seconds)


Anatomical Scan:
TR/TE = 1600 / 36 ms, RARE factor = 8, Echo spacing = 9 ms; Averages = 3; FOV = 18 × 16. mm2, in-plane resolution = 168 × 150 μm2, slice thickness = 800 μm, tacq = 1 min 3 s


Functional Scan:
TE/TR = 40 / 1500 ms, PFT = 1.5, FOV = 18 x 16.1 mm2, in-plane resolution = 269 x 268 μm2, slice thickness = 1.5 mm, tacq= 6 min 50 s
